    /*  We will write a program that generates a random number and asks the player to guess
        it. If the player’s guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays “Lower
        number please”. Similarly, if the user’s guess is too low, the program prints “Higher
        number please”.
        When the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the number of
        guesses the player used to arrive at the number.
        Hint: Use loop & use a random number generator.  */
